# JSON_Fuzzer

This is a simple JSON Generator that I created for a project. It can create the valid JSON data types as well as nested arrays.

It is designed to provide input to parsers that expect input from stdin. 

I provided a basic test harness (yes I love BASH) to get you started.

Have fun and if you find a bug with it let me know.
